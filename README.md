# housing-regression
Machine Learning project using California housing data. Performed EDA, handled missing values, encoded categorical data, standardized features, and built Linear Regression models to predict house prices. Includes model evaluation and visualizations.


California House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project uses the California Housing dataset to predict median home values based on demographic and housing features. A Linear Regression model is used to analyze the relationship between features and house prices, and evaluate its accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Build a Machine Learning model to predict home prices in California and understand the relationship between features such as median income, location, and number of rooms with home values.

ðŸ›  Technology

Python

Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab

ðŸ§ª Main Steps

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, one-hot encoding, standardization)

Linear Regression model building and training (multi-feature and single feature)

Model evaluation using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Visualization of prediction results
